This project aimed to analyse a cleaned dataset "World Food Production" available at Kaggle.

On folder "01_data_files", it can be found the raw dataset and the processed files. Firstly, it was used python to clean even further some redundant names and to reorganize the columns. That data was sent to MySQL, where I queried only fruits producted in Portugal and Spain. The scripts can be found on "02/scripts".

In Tableau, I decided to explore only the Grape production and to compare it between the two countrys. In "03/views" is the Tableau file with my work, and in the text file is my Tableau Public link profile.
